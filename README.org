* An engineering core
   Computer science is not quite engineering.

   But, it's close enough.

   Computer scientists will find themselves working with engineers.

   Computer scientists and traditional engineers need to speak the same language--a language rooted in real analysis, linear algebra, probability and physics.

   Computer scientists ought to take physics through electromagnetism. But, to do that, they'll need take up through multivariate calculus, (and differential equations for good measure).

   In constructing sound simulations, a command of probability and (often times) linear algebra is invaluable. In interpreting results, there is no substitute for a solid understanding of statistics.
